          Hi, I’m Sayali—a Computer Engineering student at SPPU, passionate about building meaningful tech solutions. My journey started with a love for GTA Vice City, which sparked my curiosity for technology and coding.

          Since then, I’ve developed projects ranging from weather apps to <strong>Samatva</strong>, an AI-powered pose correction platform. My toolkit includes Python, Java, JavaScript, and Streamlit, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies.
